# This project implements an automatic text summarization tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system takes lengthy user-provided text as input and generates a concise and meaningful summary while intelligently handling user-defined summary length limits.A pre-trained Transformer-based model (BART) is used to ensure high-quality summaries. The tool includes smart length handling, which prevents runtime errors when users provide very large summary lengths by dynamically adjusting token limits based on the input size.The project is implemented in Python and executed using Google Colab, making it lightweight, reproducible, and easy to run without local environment setup.

# Tools used

# Python – Core programming language used for implementing the summarization logic

# Hugging Face Transformers – Used to load and run the pre-trained text summarization model

# Pre-trained Model (BART – facebook/bart-large-cnn) – Generates accurate and concise summaries from long text

# Google Colab – Cloud-based development environment used to write, execute, and test the code
